# Distributed-Wifi-Capability-Collector(DWCC)
This project is designed to passively collect WIFI(802.11) management frames from inexpensive sensors distruted to see what features and specifications your WIFI clients support.

The plan is to collect pcaps then analyze them extracting the relevant data on the sensor.  Then sending it to a central database.  

## Supported collected info
The following specifications and features are collected and in the future we will include reports displaying the results of the collection.
* 80 Mhz channel support
* 160 Mhz channel support
* 802.11W

## Hardware examples
__Example 1:__
* Wireless=Alfa AWUS051NH ($70)
* CPU=Raspberry Pi 3 ($39)
* You would still SD card, case,  and power supply
* Cost=~$150

__Example 2:__
* TBD
